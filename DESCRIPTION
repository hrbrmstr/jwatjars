SystemRequirements: Java
Description: By separating out 'JAR' files from 'rJava'-based packages, such packages
   can have a lighter filesystem footprint, especially when they are likely to change 
   at a more rapid pace than the underlying libraries they depend upon. Core library 
   files from the 'Java Web Archive Toolkit' <https://sbforge.org/display/JWAT/JWAT> 
   are included and the package version aligns with the underlying 'JAR' release version.
