#' Java '.jar' Files for 'jwatr'
#'
#' By separating out 'JAR' files from 'rJava'-based packages, such packages
#' can have a lighter filesystem footprint, especially when they are likely to change
#' at a more rapid pace than the underlying libraries they depend upon. Core library
#' files from the 'Java Web Archive Toolkit' <https://sbforge.org/display/JWAT/JWAT>
#' are included and the package version aligns with the underlying 'JAR' release version.
