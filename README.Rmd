`jwatjars` : Java '.jar' Files for 'jwatr'

By separating out 'JAR' files from 'rJava'-based packages, such packages
can have a lighter filesystem footprint, especially when they are likely to change 
at a more rapid pace than the underlying libraries they depend upon. Core library 
files from the 'Java Web Archive Toolkit' <https://sbforge.org/display/JWAT/JWAT>.

Intended to be used with [`jwatr`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/jwatr).
